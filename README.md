# San Francisco Bad Date List

The Bad Date List is a community-based violence intervention tool utilized by sex workers to share information regarding “bad dates.” A Bad Date may be any person who threatens, behaves violently towards, robs, extorts, or engages in any behavior that violates the agreed upon terms and boundaries of the exchange.

This project was funded by St James Infirmary and the Department on the Status Women (SF Gov).

This project was built as a mobile first app utilizing the MERN stack. The front-end is hosted at https://github.com/DianaVashti/sji-bdl-client/. This project is currently open source.

You can access this app from your mobile device at http://stjamesbaddatelist.herokuapp.com/
